          <p>
            I’m a front-end software engineer who loves building clean,
            user-friendly web experiences that look great and perform even
            better. With several years of professional experience, I specialize
            in turning complex requirements into intuitive interfaces using
            modern tools like React, TypeScript, and Next.js. I’m comfortable
            owning features end to end—from collaborating with designers on
            UI/UX decisions to shipping production-ready code through CI/CD
            pipelines.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my current role, I’ve led front-end development on
            enterprise-scale projects, modernized legacy flows, and built highly
            interactive applications with real-time functionality. I care deeply
            about performance, accessibility, and maintainability, and I enjoy
            finding the balance between elegant design and solid engineering.
            Writing clean, reusable components and improving developer
            experience are things I take pride in.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beyond code, I’m a strong team player who communicates clearly and
            enjoys working cross-functionally with product, QA, and backend
            teams. I’m always learning, always improving, and genuinely excited
            about building products that users enjoy and businesses can rely on.
            If you’re looking for a front-end engineer who can ship quality work
            and be a positive presence on your team, I’d love to connect.

              <h3>HTML</h3>
              <p>
                I use semantic HTML to build accessible, well-structured
                interfaces that support strong SEO and screen-reader
                compatibility. I focus on writing clean, maintainable markup
                that provides a solid foundation for styling and interactivity.
                I ensure every page is structured for clarity, performance, and
                long-term scalability.

              <h3>CSS</h3>
              <p>
                I leverage modern CSS techniques to create responsive, visually
                appealing layouts that work across all devices. I'm comfortable
                with Flexbox, Grid, animations, and architectural patterns that
                keep styles organized. My goal is to transform design concepts
                into clean, consistent user experiences.

              <h3>JavaScript</h3>
              <p>
                I write modern JavaScript focused on clarity, reliability, and
                performance. I use ES6+ features to build dynamic, interactive
                interfaces that provide seamless user experiences. I'm
                experienced in debugging, optimizing, and architecting
                JavaScript code for scalable applications.

              <h3>TypeScript</h3>
              <p>
                I use TypeScript to build safer, more maintainable applications
                through strong typing and predictable code behavior. I enjoy
                designing clear type systems and interfaces that improve
                developer experience. With TypeScript, I reduce bugs, improve
                refactoring, and increase long-term stability.

              <h3>React</h3>
              <p>
                I build reusable, component-driven UIs in React that prioritize
                performance and maintainability. I'm experienced with hooks,
                state management patterns, and rendering optimizations. My focus
                is on creating intuitive, responsive, and accessible front-end
                experiences.

              <h3>Next.js</h3>
              <p>
                I use Next.js to develop fast, production-ready applications
                with SSR, SSG, and API routes. I take advantage of its routing,
                data-fetching patterns, and performance optimizations. This
                enables me to build scalable apps with excellent SEO and user
                experience.

              <h3>Node.js</h3>
              <p>
                I build backend services with Node.js that are efficient,
                secure, and easy to extend. I use it to create REST APIs, handle
                server-side logic, and interact with databases. My focus is on
                writing clean server code that supports robust front-end
                applications.

              <h3>TailwindCSS</h3>
              <p>
                I use TailwindCSS to rapidly build responsive, consistent UI
                while keeping my styles clean and maintainable. Its
                utility-first approach helps me iterate quickly and stay aligned
                with design requirements. I use component extraction and custom
                configuration to create scalable style systems.

            <div>
              <h3>Jest</h3>
              <p>
                I rely on Jest to write fast, reliable unit tests that ensure
                code correctness and stability. I enjoy creating clear test
                suites that prevent regressions and improve developer
                confidence. With Jest, I maintain high-quality code across
                growing codebases.

              <h3>Cypress</h3>
              <p>
                I use Cypress to test full user flows and guarantee that
                critical application features work as expected. Its real-browser
                testing gives me confidence in UI behavior, integrations, and
                edge cases. I write tests that simulate real user interactions
                and protect the product from regressions.

                I use Git daily to manage version control, maintain clean commit
                histories, and collaborate effectively with teams. I'm
                comfortable with branching strategies, pull requests, and
                resolving merge conflicts. My goal is to keep projects
                organized, traceable, and easy for teams to work on.

                I set up CI/CD pipelines to automate testing, building, and
                deployments for consistent and reliable releases. Automation
                helps me catch issues early and ship features faster. I focus on
                creating pipelines that are efficient, secure, and easy for
                teams to maintain.

                I design and build APIs that are cleanly structured, performant,
                and easy to consume. I enjoy writing clear documentation and
                ensuring endpoints follow predictable patterns. My API work

                I prioritize front-end performance by optimizing rendering,
                reducing bundle sizes, and improving load times. I regularly use
                profiling tools to diagnose bottlenecks and improve
                responsiveness. My goal is always to deliver fast, smooth, and
                accessible user experiences.
